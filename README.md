# UK Planning Scraper

**PRE-ALPHA: Only works with Idox and Northgate sites and spews a lot of stuff
to STDOUT. Not for production use.**

This gem scrapes planning applications data from UK local planning authority
websites, eg Westminster City Council. Data is returned as an array of hashes,
one hash for each planning application.

This scraper gem doesn't use a database. Storing the output is up to you. It's
just a convenient way to get the data.

Currently this only works for Idox and Northgate sites. The ultimate aim is to
provide a consistent interface in a single gem for all variants of all planning
systems: Idox Public Access, Northgate Planning Explorer, OcellaWeb, Agile
Planning and all the one-off systems.

This project is not affiliated with any organisation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'uk_planning_scraper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it directly:

    $ gem install uk_planning_scraper

## Usage

### First, require your stuff

```ruby
require 'uk_planning_scraper'
require 'pp'
```

### Scrape from a council

Applications in Westminster decided in the last seven days:

```ruby
pp UKPlanningScraper::Authority.named('Westminster').decided_days(7).scrape
```

### Scrape from a bunch of councils

Scrape the last week's planning decisions across the whole of
London (actually 23 of the 35 authorities right now):

```ruby
authorities = UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tagged('london')

authorities.each do |authority|
  applications = authority.decided_days(7).scrape
  pp applications
  # You'll probably want to save `applications` to your database here
end
```

### Satisfy your niche interests

Launderette applications validated in the last seven days in Scotland:

```ruby
authorities = UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tagged('scotland')

authorities.each do |authority|
  applications = authority.validated_days(7).keywords('launderette').scrape
  pp applications # You'll probably want to save `apps` to your database here
end
```

###Â More scrape parameter methods

Chain as many scrape parameter methods on a `UKPlanningScraper::Authority`
object as you like, making sure that `scrape` comes last.

```ruby
received_from(Date.parse("1 Jan 2016"))
received_to(Date.parse("31 Dec 2016"))

# Received in the last n days (including today)
# Use instead of received_to, received_from
received_days(7) 

validated_to(Date.today)
validated_from(Date.today - 30)
validated_days(7) # instead of validated_to, validated_from

decided_to(Date.today)
decided_from(Date.today - 30)
decided_days(7) # instead of decided_to, decided_from

# Check that the systems you're scraping return the
# results you expect for multiple keywords (AND or OR?)
keywords("hip gable") 

applicant_name("Mr and Mrs Smith") # Currently Idox only
application_type("Householder") # Currently Idox only
development_type("") # Currently Idox only

scrape # runs the scraper
```

### Save to a SQLite database

This gem has no interest whatsoever in persistence. What you do with the data it
outputs is up to you: relational databases, document stores, VHS and clay
tablets are all blissfully none of its business. But using the
[ScraperWiki](https://github.com/openaustralia/scraperwiki-ruby) gem is a really
easy way to store your data:

```ruby
require 'scraperwiki' # Must be installed, of course
ScraperWiki.save_sqlite([:authority_name, :council_reference], applications)
```

That `applications` param can be a hash or an array of hashes, which is what
gets returned by our `Authority.scrape`.

### Find authorities by tag

Tags are always lowercase and one word.

```ruby
london_auths = UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tagged('london')
```

We've got tags for areas:

- london
- innerlondon
- outerlondon
- northlondon
- southlondon
- greatermanchester
- surrey
- wales

We also automatically add tags for software systems:

- idox
- northgate
- ocellaweb
- agileplanning
- unknownsystem -- for when we can't identify the system

and whatever you'd like to add that would be useful to others.

### WTF is up with London?

London has got 32 London Boroughs, tagged `londonboroughs`. These are the
councils under the authority of the Mayor of London and the Greater London
Authority.

It has 33 councils: the London Boroughs plus the City of London (named `City of
London`). We don't currently have a tag for this, but if you want to add
`londoncouncils` please go ahead.

And it's got 35 local planning authorities: the 33 councils plus the two
`londondevelopmentcorporations`, named `London Legacy Development Corporation`
and `Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation`. The tag `london` covers
all (and only) the 35 local planning authorities in London.

```ruby
UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tagged('londonboroughs').size
 # => 32
 
UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tagged('londondevelopmentcorporations').size
 # => 2

UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tagged('london').size
 # => 35
```

### More fun with Authority tags

```ruby
UKPlanningScraper::Authority.named('Merton').tags
 # => ["england", "london", "londonboroughs", "northgate", "outerlondon", "southlondon"]

UKPlanningScraper::Authority.not_tagged('london')
 # => [...]

UKPlanningScraper::Authority.named('Islington').tagged?('southlondon')
 # => false
```

### List all authorities

```ruby
UKPlanningScraper::Authority.all.each { |a| puts a.name }
```

### List all tags

```ruby
pp UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tags
```
## Add your favourite local planning authorities

The list of authorities is in a CSV file in `/lib/uk_planning_scraper`:

https://github.com/adrianshort/uk_planning_scraper/blob/master/lib/uk_planning_scraper/authorities.csv

The easiest way to add to or edit this list is to edit within GitHub (use the
  pencil icon) and create a new pull request for your changes. If accepted, your
  changes will be available to everyone with the next version of the gem.

The file format is one line per authority, with comma-separated:

- Name (omit "the", "council", "borough of", "city of", etc. and write "and" not
  "&", except for `City of London` which is a special case)
- URL of the search form (use the advanced search URL if there is one)
- Tags (use as many comma-separated tags as is reasonable, lowercase and all one
  word.)

There's no need to manually add tags to the `authorities.csv` file for the
software systems like `idox`, `northgate` etc as these are added automatically.

Please check the tag list before you change anything:

```ruby
pp UKPlanningScraper::Authority.tags
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
